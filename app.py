# create a rock paper scissors game
# The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools and these will be compared to see who wins.
# The winner of the game is based in three simple rules: #
# Rock wins against scissors.
# Scissors win against paper.
# Paper wins against rock.
# If both players choose the same tool, the game ends in a tie.
# The game will be implemented in the following way:
# The computer will randomly choose one of the three tools.
# The user will enter their name.
# The user will choose one of the three tools.
# A message indicating who won the game will be displayed.
# The game will be implemented using the following steps:
# Import the random module.
# Define a list of the three tools: rock, paper, and scissors.
# Define a variable that will store the name of the user.
# Define a variable that will store the name of the computer.
# Define a variable that will store the tool chosen by the user.
# Define a variable that will store the tool chosen by the computer.
# Define a variable that will store the result of the game.
# Define a function that will print the message indicating who won the game.
# The player can choose one of the three options rock, paper, or scissors and should be warned if they enter an invalid option.
#At each round, the player must enter one of the options in the list and be informed if they won, lost, or tied with the opponent.
#By the end of each round, the player can choose whether to play again.
#Display the player's score at the end of the game.
#The minigame must handle user inputs, putting them in lowercase and informing the user if the option is invalid.
